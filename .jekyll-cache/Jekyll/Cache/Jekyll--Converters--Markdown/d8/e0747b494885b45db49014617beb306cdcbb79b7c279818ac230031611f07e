<p>July, 2020 – Present</p>

<p><em>Research Assistant</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Participated in the proposal of a novel immune system inspired adversarial learning algorithm, implemented and tested the architecture in pytorch;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experimented on the model initialization mechanisms, affinity measurements and multiple hyperparameter settings, accelerated and stablized the affinity maturation simulation process;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compared RAILS and DkNN defenses both under white-box attacks (PGD) on CNN and under black-box attacks (ZOO &amp; HopSkipJump) on the whole architecture, the novel algorithm outperformed its counterparts in adversarial cases and preserved accuracy given the clean inputs.</p>

<p><em>Research Assistant</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Processed ∼500M transaction data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Service, derived predictor variables including morphine milligram equivalents and opioid-involved overdose death rate by CDC prescription guideline and Michigan demographic data</li>
  <li>Investigated the relationship between high-dose opioid transaction with factors such as pharmacy ownership, geographical location and patient composition with weighted least square linear models</li>
  <li>Built three models using standard logistic regression, random forest and non-ignorable missing data methods (Ibrahim and Lipsitz algorithm with Firth penalty) and compared the model performances on the hold-out set</li>
