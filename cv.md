## :rocket: Projects

### RAILS: Robust Adversarial Immune Learning System [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10485.pdf)

July, 2020 – Present

*Research Assistant*

- Participated in the proposal of a novel immune system inspired adversarial learning algorithm, implemented and tested the architecture in pytorch;
  
-  Experimented on the model initialization mechanisms, affinity measurements and multiple hyperparameter settings, accelerated and stablized the affinity maturation simulation process;
  
- Compared RAILS and DkNN defenses both under white-box attacks (PGD) on CNN and under black-box attacks (ZOO & HopSkipJump) on the whole architecture, the novel algorithm outperformed its counterparts in adversarial cases and preserved accuracy given the clean inputs.
  

### UM-OIG Project: High-dose Opioid Transaction Prediction and U.S. Medicaid Pharmacy Fraudulence Risk Evaluation
May 2020 – Sept. 2020

*Research Assistant*

- Processed ∼500M transaction data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Service, derived predictor variables including morphine milligram equivalents and opioid-involved overdose death rate by CDC prescription guideline and Michigan demographic data

- Investigated the relationship between high-dose opioid transaction with factors such as pharmacy ownership, geographical location and patient composition with weighted least square linear models

- Built three models using standard logistic regression, random forest and non-ignorable missing data methods (Ibrahim and Lipsitz algorithm with Firth penalty) and compared the model performances on the hold-out set
