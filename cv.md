### RAILS: Robust Adversarial Immune Learning System
July, 2020 – Present

*Research Assistant*

- Participated in the proposal of a novel immune system inspired adversarial learning algorithm, implemented
  and tested the architecture in pytorch;

-  Experimented on the model initialization mechanisms, affinity measurements and multiple hyperparameter
  settings, accelerated and stablized the affinity maturation simulation process;

- Compared RAILS and DkNN defenses both under white-box attacks (PGD) on CNN and under black-box
  attacks (ZOO & HopSkipJump) on the whole architecture, the novel algorithm outperformed its counter-
  parts in adversarial cases and preserved accuracy given the clean inputs.

  *The paper is currently under review of AISTATS 2021*

### UM-OIG Project: High-dose Opioid Transaction Prediction and U.S. Medicaid Pharmacy Fraudulence Risk Evaluation
May, 2020 – Sept. 2020

*Research Assistant*

- Processed ∼500M transaction data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Service, derived
  predictor variables including morphine milligram equivalents and opioid-involved overdose death rate by
  CDC prescription guideline and Michigan demographic data;
- Investigated the relationship between high-dose opioid transaction with factors such as pharmacy owner-
  ship, geographical location and patient composition with weighted least square linear models;
- Built three models using standard logistic regression, random forest and non-ignorable missing data meth-
  ods (Ibrahim and Lipsitz algorithm with Firth penalty) and compared the model performances on the hold-
  out set.

### JPMorgan Shanghai Research Project: Pension Products
May, 2018 – Apr, 2019

*Research Assistant*

- Collected and analyzed seasonal data from 1974 to 2018: the investment of American Pension Fund Account
  on Mutual Funds and other economic variables;
- Established Multiple Linear Regression model of the investment of American Pension Fund account on
  mutual funds with regard to several economic factors;
-  Interpreted the model and found out the influence of U.S. economy and policies on the pension funds size.
